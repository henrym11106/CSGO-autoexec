# CSGO autoexec
my config and custom action binds for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.


"autoexec.cfg" contains my current crosshair, my custom binds for DuckJump, movement, grenade practice, sound, radar and netgraph, binds for buying, getting and using weapons & equipment, binds and settings for KZ, surf & bhop, etc.

this file changes a quite a few settings including volume levels so read each part through before using.
settings defined within should be set in the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings.


"surft.cfg" is my online surf config. it sets up a buch of command binds and enables turnbinds which can be toggled.


"csexec.cfg" is for CS 1.6, "csexec.cfg" is for CS:Source - different weapons etc from CSGO


the wierdly-named, all-caps files in the 'Custom Comp-DM Mode' folder are configs for offline play or custom servers, it's basically comp behaviour deatchmatch. load any map offline in casual mode and exec. 2QUIET is pretty great.

the "splat___.webm" files are smaller, static backgrounds for the enemy counter in DZ.
drop in to [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos] and replace or rename the old file.
whatever file in the "videos" folder is named "splat.webm" will be used as the counter background.
the file here named "splat.webm" is a completely transparent background.

"items_game-realistic.txt" changes weapon stats and behaviour to more realistic values, mostly by raising firing rates and/or changes to accuracy. this cannot be used online, it's just interesting to play with.
to use, launch steam offline (if you're getting kicked anyway, disable your internet) and place file in [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/scripts/items] - rename the original "items_game.txt" file to say "items_game1.txt" then change "items_game-realistic.txt" to "items_game.txt"

*remember to revert "items_game" before playing online!*
