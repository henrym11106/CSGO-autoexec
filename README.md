# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 


this file contains my current crosshair, binds for buying and using weapons & equipment, custom binds for sound, radar and netgraph, binds for unlimited nades & auto bhop for offline practice, etc.

this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined here should only be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the "Crosshairs" file also has some launch options at the end. some commands may prevent launch on some systems.

the "splat---.webm" files are smaller, static backgrounds for the enemy counter in DZ that won't block other parts of the HUD.
drop in to Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos and replace or rename the old file.
whatever file in the "videos" folder is named "splat.webm" will be used as the counter background. I use the blank one.


"ara.cfg" and "dma.cfg" are Arms Race Aim and Death Match Aim, set to run on a Yesber-made aim map.
add to Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg and run "exec dma" or "exec ara".
"dma2.cfg" changes some rules for bot practice. change as needed and exec after map load.

for best results on this aim map, kick all bots then add enemy bots as desired.


"hl2exec.cfg" is my basic config for older Source games.
