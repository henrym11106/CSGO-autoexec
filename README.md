# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.


thise file contains radar and sound tweaks, binds for buying and using weapons & equipment, unlimited nades & auto bhop for offline practice, etc.

regularly updated, this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined in an autoexec can only be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the "Crosshairs" file has drop-in experimental xhairs. so hard to decide.
