# CSGO autoexec
my config and custom action binds for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.


"autoexec.cfg" contains my current crosshair, my custom binds for DuckJump, movement, grenade practice, sound, radar and netgraph, binds for buying, getting and using weapons & equipment, binds for KZ, surf & bhop, etc.

this file changes a quite a few settings including volume levels so read each part through before using.

settings defined here should be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the wierdly-named, all-caps files are configs for offline or custom servers, basically comp behaviour deatchmatch.
load a map offline casual and exec

the "splat___.webm" files are smaller, static backgrounds for the enemy counter in DZ.
drop in to [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos] and replace or rename the old file.
whatever file in the "videos" folder is named "splat.webm" will be used as the counter background.
the file here named "splat.webm" is a completely transparent background.


"items_game-realistic.txt" changes weapon stats and behaviour to more realistic values, mostly by raising firing rates and/or changes to accuracy. this cannot be used online, it's just interesting to play with.
to use, launch steam offline (if you're getting kicked anyway, disable your internet) and place file in [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/scripts/items] - rename the original "items_game.txt" file to say "items_game1.txt" then change "items_game-realistic.txt" to "items_game.txt"

*remember to revert "items_game" before playing online!*


"csexec.cfg" is for CS 1.6 and CS:S - different weapons etc from CSGO
I also have configs here tweaked for a few other games eg gmod
