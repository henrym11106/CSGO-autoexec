# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 


this file contains my current crosshair, binds for buying and using weapons & equipment, custom binds for sound, radar and netgraph, binds for unlimited nades & auto bhop for offline practice, etc.

regularly updated, this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined in an autoexec can only be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the "Crosshairs" file has drop-in experimental xhairs and some launch options at the end.

"splat.webm" is a file to replace the background of the enemy counter in DZ. drop in to Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos, replace the existing file.
