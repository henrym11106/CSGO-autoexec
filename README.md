# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.


thise file contains radar and sound tweaks, binds for buying and using weapons and equipment, unlimited nades, auto bhop, etc.

regularly updated, this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined in this file can only be set within this file as they load on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.
