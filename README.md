# CSGO autoexec
my base config for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 


this file contains my current crosshair, binds for buying and using weapons & equipment, custom binds for sound, radar and netgraph, binds for unlimited nades & auto bhop for offline practice, etc.

this file changes a quite a few settings including volume levels so read it through before using.

settings defined here should only be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the "Crosshairs" file also has launch options at the end. some #commands may prevent game launch on some systems.

the "splat___.webm" files are smaller, static backgrounds for the enemy counter in DZ that won't block other parts of the HUD.
drop in to [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos] and replace or rename the old file.
whatever file in the "videos" folder is named "splat.webm" will be used as the counter background. I use the blank one.


"ara.cfg" and "dma.cfg" are Arms Race Aim & Death Match Aim, set to run on a Yesber-made aim map.
add to Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg and run "exec dma" or "exec ara".
the "bots-<gun>" files kick all bots and change some rules for bot practice. "bots-add-" add 15 of that type of bot.
adjust as needed and exec after map load. add bots as desired.


"items_game-realistic.txt" changes weapon stats and behaviour to more realistic values. this obviously cannot be used online, it's just interesting to play with. could improve gameplay IMO.
to use, launch steam offline (if you're getting kicked anyway, disable your internet) and place file in [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/scripts/items] - rename the original "items_game.txt" file to say "items_game1.txt" then change "items_game-realistic.txt" to "items_game.txt" 
*[revert before playing online!]*


"hl2exec.cfg" is my base config for older Source games.
