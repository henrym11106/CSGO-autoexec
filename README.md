# CSGO autoexec
my config and custom action binds for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.


"autoexec.cfg" contains my current crosshair, my custom binds for Exo-DuckJump, movement, sound, radar and netgraph, binds for buying, spawning and using weapons & equipment, binds for nade practice, binds for KZ, surf & bhop offline, etc.

this file changes a quite a few settings including volume levels so read each part through before using.

settings defined here should be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.


the "splat___.webm" files are smaller, static backgrounds for the enemy counter in DZ that won't block other parts of the HUD.
drop in to [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/panorama/videos] and replace or rename the old file.
whatever file in the "videos" folder is named "splat.webm" will be used as the counter background.
the file here named "splat.webm" is a completely transparent background.


"ara.cfg" and "dma.cfg" are Arms Race Aim & Death Match Aim, set to run on a Yesber-made aim map.
add to Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg and run "exec dma" or "exec ara".
the "bots-<gun>" files kick all bots and change some rules for bot practice. "bots-add-" add 15 of that type of bot.
adjust as needed and exec after map load. add bots as desired.


"items_game-realistic.txt" changes weapon stats and behaviour to more realistic values, mostly by raising firing rates and/or changes to accuracy. this obviously cannot be used online, it's just interesting to play with.
to use, launch steam offline (if you're getting kicked anyway, disable your internet) and place file in [steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/scripts/items] - rename the original "items_game.txt" file to say "items_game1.txt" then change "items_game-realistic.txt" to "items_game.txt"

*-remember to revert "items_game" before playing online!*


"csexec.cfg" is for CS 1.6 and CS:S - different weapons etc from CSGO
I also have configs here tweaked for a few other games
