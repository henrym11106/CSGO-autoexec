# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

regularly updated, this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined in this file can opnly be set from within the file because they load on game launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.
