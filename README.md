# CSGO autoexec
my autoexec file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 


this file contains my current crosshair, binds for buying and using weapons & equipment, binds for sound, a bind for radar and netgraph, binds for unlimited nades & auto bhop for offline practice, etc.

regularly updated, this file changes a quite a few settings (including volume levels) so read it through before using.

settings defined in an autoexec can only be set within the file as they apply on launch, overriding the in-game settings menu.

the "Crosshairs" file has drop-in experimental xhairs
